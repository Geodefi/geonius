### Step 1

Navigate to `EC2` > `Instances` > `Launch instances`.
![aws launch](../img/aws_launch.png)

### Step 2

Select the **m5.xlarge** instance type, featuring 16 GiB RAM and 4 vCPUs.
![aws instance](../img/aws_instance.png)

### Step 3

If you do not already have a key-pair, click create key pair and create a file with the .pem extension.

>Use the .pem file only for this instance and never share or lose it!

![aws ssh](../img/aws_ssh.png)

### Step 4

A 2TB SSD will be enough for ethereum mainnet. However, there might be a better setup for this with elastic storage.

Connect!

```bash
chmod 400 geonius.pem

ssh -i geonius.pem ubuntu@ec2-3-44-55-66.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```
